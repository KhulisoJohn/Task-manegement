# Task Management App

A simple and efficient **Kanban-style** task management web application built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **CSS**, and **TypeScript**. This app allows users to manage and organize their tasks in an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. You can add, update, delete, move, and mark tasks as completed, simulating a Kanban board.

This project is built to reflect the **Tecbridle Foundation Cohort**, incorporating key concepts learned during the React.js, including TypeScript for type safety and enhanced development.

## Features

- Add tasks with titles and descriptions.
- Drag and drop tasks between different columns (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Completed").
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**.
- Custom styling with **CSS** for enhanced visuals.
- LocalStorage (optional): Store tasks locally on the browser for persistence.
- Strong type safety using **TypeScript**.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs quickly.
- **CSS**: For custom styling to enhance the user experience.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds type safety and enhanced development experience.
- **LocalStorage** (optional): For storing tasks locally on the browser.
